MCCLogic is a software simulation package for training rig electricians to troubleshoot MCC Starters.

It is written in C# for a Windows PC.

The complete program and source files, including a downloadable installation and user manual is available on this Github page.

The simulation is based on a single MCC starter.

The software is built of two parts: the graphic representation of the system equipment, and a mathematical simulation of the analogue circuits. It leans heavily on a modified version of SharpCircuit (available on GitHub), a C# port of Paul Falstad's excellent circuit simulator applet.

The student can probe terminals on the simulation screens and measure the voltage at each point.

Faults can be applied to the circuit, which then allows the student to practice identification of faults by understanding the schematics and the observed measurements.

Faults can be introduced manually or from a pre-defined timed sequence of events controlled by a script running in the background. Scripts can be customised and saved and can create complex scenarios which will test the abilities of the most experienced technician.

This program assumes that the user understands what an MCC starter is, what it is used for and how it works, and is familiar with the terminology associated with it.

## Installation

The software has complex calculations to perform to simulate the analogue circuitry, so a Windows (version 7 or later) PC with plenty of memory (at least 4GB) and a powerful CPU will improve the user experience. The software will run on 32-bit machines, but these may experience memory problems due to memory fragmentation, so 64-bit is recommended.

A mouse with a scroll wheel is required.

To install, download mcclogic.zip and run the setup.exe file.

A mouse with a scroll wheel is required.

## User Manual

There is a PDF User Manual available for download.
